    <h1>Disinformation in the Twenty First Century</h1>
        <h2><u>What is disinformation?</u></h2>
        Disinformation is false or otherwise manipulated information that is spread with the intention to mislead people. Whereas
        misinformation is accidentally or inintentionally misleading, disinformation is purposeful and malicious. When designing
        disinformation, content creators may use the following tactics to make their falsified information more believable:
        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Appeals to common sense</li>
                <li>Noncontextual images</li>
                <li>Edited images</li>
                <li>Falsified evidence</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exagerated statistics</li>
                        <li>Falsified statistics</li>
                        <li>Falsified experts</li>
                        <li>Attributing quotes to someone <br>
                            other than their real author</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        These tactics can successfully manipulate thoughtful, well-educated citizens if they are unaware of their own vulnerabilities.
        <h2><u>Why would someone use disinformation?</u></h2>
        Disinformation can be a powerful tool to influence people's thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. Disinformation can shift political
        narratives, exert social control over both formal and informal groups of people, and earn significant financial profits. From
        products falsely marketed to consumers to state-sanctioned political disinformation, disinformation has touched <b>every</b> part
        of our planet.
        <br>
        For example, if I needed to sell hundreds of pounds of tea that didn't perform well when tested by consumers, I may need to
        come up with a marketing strategy besides taste. Knowing that new mothers are a vulnerable population, I could try to target them
        as a consumer base to profit off of their desire for healthy children. To do so, I can use AI generation like ChatGPT to create a
        news article to "legitimize" any claim I can image about my product. Then, I go to social media and post the following:

        <b>New Study Finds Dangerous Microplastic Levels in Human Breast Milk</b>
        <br>
        A groundbreaking new study published by the International Health & Environment Consortium (IH&EC) has revealed the widespread presence of 
        microplastics in human breast milk, prompting new concerns about infant exposure to synthetic contaminants.
        <br>
        Researchers analyzed breast milk samples from 160 women across six industrialized nations. Using advanced AI-assisted spectrographic scanning, they 
        detected microplastic concentrations ranging from 72 to 139 parts per billion (ppb) in the milk. Toxicologists consider these levels biologically active.
        <br>
        The detected microplastics included polyethylene, polypropylene, and trace amounts of bisphenol-coated particles, all of which may interfere with infant 
        immune and hormonal development.
        <br>
        However, the study also documented a potential breakthrough: participants who consumed Lactoclear Detox Blend, a daily herbal infusion formulated to bind 
        and eliminate microplastic residue, showed a 121% reduction in microplastic levels in their breast milk after just 60 days.

        This information and image that are generated with ChatGPT may influence people to spend thier money on a product that does not
        actually provide any benefits.
        <br>

        <i>Everyone</i> no matter how affluent, intelligent, or education they are, is susceptible to disinformation; however, knowing
        the factors that increase your likelihood of believing disinformation can be a powerful preventative tool.


        <h2><u>How can I protect myself from disinformation?</u></h2>
        Researchers are still learning the best ways to prepare people for recognizing disinformation so that they are not manipulated by it;
        however, one digital literacy tool that works well is by carefully selecting your news sources.
